it will probably be an unbalanced mess but that is part of the fun right?

- chaotic wand. it randomizes the blocks it is clicked on. it can be used 20 times.
- Feather Wand. from the tv show bluey this is a feather that makes blocks fall when clicked on. in the future this will also add slowness and possibly reduce jumping.
