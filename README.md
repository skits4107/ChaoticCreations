# Chaotic Creations

this mod is a collabrative project between skits4107 and kakj. this mod is an in progress mod that will add many chaotic elements to minecraft. 
it will probably be an unbalanced mess but that is part of the fun right?

# currently in mod

- chaotic wand. it randomizes the blocks it is clicked on. it can be used 20 times.
- Feather Wand. from the tv show bluey this is a feather that makes blocks fall when clicked on. in the future this will also add slowness and possibly reduce jumping.
- Wizard staff can cast various spells. you use spell crystals to change spells
- spell crystals. used to change wizard staff spells. current spell crystals are: fire blast, lightning, defense (creates wall of stone)
- Lunar Block. it is only visiable or interactable during nighttime. it vanishes during day time. 

# known bugs
